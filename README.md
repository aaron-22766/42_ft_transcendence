## ðŸ—£ About

This project is about doing something youâ€™ve never done before. Remind yourself the beginning of your journey in computer science. Look at you now. Time to shine!

This project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest! Thanks to your website, users will play Pong with others. You have to provide a nice user interface and real-time multiplayer online games!

For this team project, I teamed up with [Markus](https://github.com/kurz-m), [Florian](https://github.com/flolau2k) and [Sanjok](https://github.com/bsanjok).
